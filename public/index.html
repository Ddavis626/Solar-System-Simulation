      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is also the closest to the sun.
        If you were to stand of the surface, the sun would appear 3x larger. Ironically, the small 
        planet is not the hottest of the bunch. That crown is worn by Mercury's sister planet, Venus.
        Since it is the cloest planet to the sun, it is the fastest traveling planet. Opposed to Earth's 
        365 day a year cycle, Mercury only has 88 days. There has been a number of robotic visitors
        such as Mainer 10 and MESSENGER. A third is on its way right now.

      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
       Venus is often called "Earth's twin" becuase they are of similar size and structure. However, That
       is where their similarites end. Venus hold the title for the hottest planet in our neighborhood
       with temperatures as high as 700°F! Venus rotates so slow compared to Earth that one day on Venus is 243 Earth days.
       Venus is also home to toxic clouds of sulfuric acid that cover the planet with a smell that'll make your eyes sweat, 
       rotten eggs. Venus leaves scientist perplexed on how the average suface of the planet is possible as young as 150
        million years old.

      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
       Earth, our home planet. The only planet that we know of that has "life" on it. Earth is the third planet away from the sun. 
       The sun is so massive compared to earth that if the sun were the size of a typival door, the Earth would be
       the size of a nickle in comparison. You'll find many types of terrains on this blue planet but water
       is by far the most vast, perfect for inhabitting creatures like us. The Earth is so good at growing and
       maintaining life that our atmosphere is like a shield against incoming meteroids that, most of which, just burn up.
       Earth is the only planet that was not named after a greek god.

      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
       Mars is the fourth planet from the sun with a dynamic enviornment and a thin atmosphere. Mars is one
       of our most explored celstial bodies and it is believed that it may have had an active past.
       NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter 
       (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the 
       Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.

      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
      Jupiter. the fifth planet from the sun is the biggest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is so massive
      that you can fit all the planets and there would still be space left over. It's famous red spot
      is a gigantic super storm that has been raging for over 100 years and is  the size of Earth.
      Jupiter's days are short only lasting about 10 hours but takes about 12 years to make a full rotation around
      the sun. Though very fient, Jupiter does has a ring like the other gas giants. It is called a gas giant
      because it is made up of complete gas, hydrogen (H2) and helium (He) to be exact, and lacks an Earth like
      surface, Though if it had one, it would likely be the size of Earth itself. Jupiter sports over 75 moons
      and though the planet itself cannot support life, some of its moons have oceans underneath the crust surface that
      may be enough to support life.

      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
      Known as the jewel of the solar system, Jupiter is known for being adorned by a beautiful ring with 7 layers.
      Like other gas giants, it is made up of mostly gas (hydrogen (H2) and helium (He)) and may have a core at its center.
      Not many missions have been made to saturn making it a rare destination. Competeing with Jupiter to have the most moons,
      Saturn has more tha 80 of them which some may be able to support life. A day on Saturn can last about 10 hours, but the years are
      29 Earth years. About two tons of Saturn's mass came from Earth—the Cassini spacecraft was intentionally vaporized in Saturn's 
      atmosphere in 2017 .

      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
      Uranus, the seventh planet  from the sun, was descovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1781. It was the first planet
      to be descovered through a telescope although it was mistaken for a comet or a star. Uranus is an ice giant, made up of 
      hot dense fluid( water, methane and ammonia) that appears icy just abover a rocky core. This planet is unique because it rotates on 
      its side. Although not as massive as its adjacent neighbors, Uranus is still 4x wider than Earth. Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate 
      once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).

      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
      Neptune, this brilliant blue ice giant is the eight and furthest planet from the sun, more than 30x the distance compared 
      to Earth. It is the only planet you cannot see with your naked eye. It was first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. 
      In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have 
      visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system. Because of dwarf planet Pluto's elliptical orbit, 
      Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun (and us) than Neptune is.

      <h2>Pluto</h2>
      <p class = "planetText">
      Although Pluto is too small to be considered a planet, (is about 1,400 miles (2,380 km) wide. That's about half the 
      width of the United States, or 2/3 the width of Earth's moon), it is one of the most fasinating dwarf planets out there.
      It has a heart-shaped glacier that's the size of Texas and Oklahoma and mountains that reach as high as the Rockies.
      It also snows on Pluto, but the snow is a red color. On July 14, 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made its historic 
      flight through the Pluto system, providing the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that 
      has transformed our understanding of these mysterious worlds on the solar system's outer frontier. Pluto has 5 moons. The largest, 
      Charon, is so big that Pluto and Charon orbit each other like a double planet.
